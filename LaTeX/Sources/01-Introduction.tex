In graph theory, a graph is an object consisting of a set of elements, called \emph{vertices}, and their pairwise relations, called \emph{edges}, that are expressed as (unordered) pairs of vertices. Graphs are used heavily for modeling routing problems, representing social networks, chip design, and many other fields.

Visualizing graphs is a fundamental aspect in the field of graph drawing and information visualization. A graph's vertices are typically drawn as small circles, with its edges being drawn as curves between their endpoints. When drawing graphs, one of the main goals is making them easy to grasp.

A popular family of algorithms for drawing graphs are so-called force-directed algorithms. In a force-directed algorithm, the graph is regarded as a particle system in which the vertices are particles, and several forces are acting on said particles. One defines these forces such that they act to bring the system into a stable equilibrium position in which its implicitly defined potential energy is at a local minimum and the resulting drawing has some desired features. Typically, one wants adjacent vertices to be close together, with non-adjacent vertices being further apart from each other. The resulting drawings of graphs are generally visually appealing and easy to grasp \cite{Kobourov}.
