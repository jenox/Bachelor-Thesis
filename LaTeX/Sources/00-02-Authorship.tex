Throughout multiple years and lectures, {Prof.~Dr.~Dorothea Wagner} got me obsessed with theoretical computer science and graph theory in particular. Thank you for introducing me to such a fascinating field, and for now giving me the opportunity to write my bachelor thesis at your institute.

I would also like to thank my advisor, {Dr.~Tamara Mchedlidze}, for her great support in the form of many suggestions and hours of helpful discussions; and especially for responding to my late-night emails when I was in desperate need of some input.

My thanks also go to all of my proofreaders for helping me make this thesis the best it could be. Specifically, I would like to thank {Florian Heininger} for many hours of physics-related discussions, and {Johannes Hubert} for always having a sympathetic ear.

Last but by no means least, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my parents and grandparents for their unfailing support and encouragement, despite my own limited devotion to staying in touch at times.

I am forever grateful for all of your support.
